At DOUBLEX, autonomous control is one of our core values. We firmly believe that everyone should have full control of their own assets and data. In the traditional financial system, users often need to manage their assets and data to centralized institutions, which brings security and privacy risks. The vision of DOUBLEX is to give users complete autonomy control, allowing them to freely manage, use and communicate their assets and data without any restrictions.

 

**3.** ***\*Fairness and transparency: Platform data and transactions are open and transparent\****

 

 Fairness and transparency are the indispensable values of the DOUBLEX. We believe that financial transactions should be fair and that everyone should have equal opportunities. To achieve this goal, we promise to keep our platform data and trading information open and transparent. Users can check the platform's data and transaction records at any time to ensure that everything is under the light and free from improper manipulation or concealment.

These three core values, decentralized, autonomous, and fair and transparent, will lead DOUBLEX to move forward in the financial world and create a more open, free and just financial experience for users. This is our firm belief, but also our commitment.

 

 

 

***\*5„ÄÅ\*******\*introduce\****

 

**1.** ***\*The origin of the DOUBLEX\****

 

***\*(1) The original intention of the founder being anonymous\****

 

 DOUBLEX Was born from an idealistic purpose, an inspiration full of doubts about the financial system and the desire to improve it. Although the identity of the founder anonymous person is hidden, his original intention is clearly ‚Äî‚Äî to break the shackles of traditional finance and build a fairer and more decentralized financial world.

Anonymous believes that the trust problems of centralized institutions and third parties in the traditional financial system have created too much unfairness and opacity. He is eager to provide equal financial opportunities for everyone, giving users the right to control their own assets and data. To achieve this vision, he is determined to use the power of blockchain technology and crypto finance to create a whole new financial ecosystem.

 

***\*(2) The rise of blockchain technology and crypto finance\****

Blockchain technology provides a solid technical foundation for decentralization, while crypto finance provides a broad possibility for financial innovation.

 The founder of DOUBLEX, Anonymous, is deeply inspired by this wave. He believes that by combining blockchain technology with crypto finance, we can build a secure, open, fair and transparent financial platform, and truly realize financial decentralization and independent control of users.

Therefore, the origin of DOUBLEX is both the pursuit of an idealist and a belief in emerging technologies and financial models. In the course of DOUBLEX development, we will continue to uphold this original intention, and strive to change the traditional financial system, and create a fairer and more open financial world.

 

**2.** ***\*The current state of crypto finance\****

 

***\*(1) Problems existing in traditional finance\****

 

 Although the traditional financial system has played an important role for some time, there are also some problems:

 

 Centralization: The traditional financial system is controlled by central banks and financial institutions, which leads to the unequal distribution of power and makes some groups inaccessible to financial services.

 Trust issues: Traditional finance requires users 'trust in intermediaries, but they sometimes violate users' trust or face security vulnerabilities.



 High costs: Traditional financial transactions often involve high fees and profits from middlemen, which increase the cost of financial services.

 

 Link of transparency: the transparency of traditional financial transactions is limited, making it difficult to view and verify transaction data.

 

Financial exclusion: In some areas, financial services are not widespread, leading to financial exclusion problems.

 

***\*(2) How can DBX solve these problems\****

 

 The mission of DOUBLEX (DBX) is to change the traditional financial system, address these problems, and create a fairer, more decentralized and transparent financial world.

DBX is committed to addressing these issues by providing an open, non-discriminatory and low-threshold financial platform. Users will have equal access to and leverage DBX's financial instruments and services, regardless of their geographical location, financial position, and background.

By achieving these goals, DOUBLEX seeks to improve the global accessibility and fairness of the financial system and create a more inclusive, transparent and credible financial future for users around the world.

 



 

 

***\*6„ÄÅ\*******\*Technical architecture\****

 

 

**1.** ***\*Blockchain technology applications\****

 

***\*(1) How the blockchain can ensure the decentralization\****

 

 Blockchain technology enhances security and transparency through its decentralized nature by ensuring that the financial system does not need central control. Here are some of the key features of how blockchain ensures decentralization:

 Distributed books: Blockchain uses distributed books technology to store data in multiple nodes on the Internet. Each node has a complete copy of the account, which means that there is no single central database or server, but thousands of nodes work together to verify and store transaction data.

 Decentralized consensus mechanism: Blockchain networks use the consensus mechanism to verify and add new transactions to the blockchain. These consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Work (Proof of Work) and Certificate of Interest (Proof of Stake), ensure that no single entity can independently control the entire network. New transactions require confirmation by most nodes to be added to the blockchain. 

 Immutable transaction records: Once data is added to the blockchain, it is almost impossible to be tampered with or deleted. This imtamability ensures the integrity of the data through encryption technology and decentralized storage protection.

 

Open transparency: All transactions on the blockchain are publicly available, and anyone can view the data on the blockchain. This transparency helps to build trust, because everyone can verify the validity of the transactions.



***\*(2) Application of blockchain technology of DBX\****

 

 DBX applies blockchain technology to the financial sector to build a decentralized financial platform. Here are the highlights of DBX's blockchain technology application:

 Smart contracts: Smart contracts are used on DBX platforms, and these contracts are executed automatically without mediation. They programmed financial rules and terms of trading to ensure safe and transparent financial transactions.

 Distributed ledger: DBX's transaction data is stored in multiple nodes on the blockchain to ensure traceability and imtamability of transactions. Users can view the transaction history at any time, ensuring the transparency of the data.

 Crycryption technology: DBX uses powerful encryption technology to protect users' assets and privacy. Each transaction is encrypted and only the parties to the transaction can unlock and access the data.

 Decentralized control: DBX does not have a single central management organization, and users jointly participate in the operation and decision-making of the network. This ensures that no individual or organization can control the platform alone, increasing the decentralized nature of the platform.

Through the application of these blockchain technologies, DBX builds a secure, transparent and decentralized financial platform, allowing users to manage their financial assets and participate in financial activities more independently.

 

**2.** ***\*Smart contract\****

 

***\*(1) The role and advantages of smart contracts\****

 

 Smart contracts are a computer program that automatically enforces contract terms. They are based on blockchain technology and have the following functions and advantagesÔºö

 Automatic execution: Smart contract automatically execute the terms of the contract without intermediary or third party intervention. Once the conditions of the contract are met, the contract immediately performs the corresponding operations, such as transferring funds or allocating digital assets.



 No trust: The execution of smart contracts is verified by multiple nodes on the blockchain network, so there is no need to trust a single entity. This increases the security and reliability of the transaction.

 Transparency: The code and execution history of smart contracts are stored on the blockchain and can be viewed by anyone. This ensures the transparency of the contract, with no hidden fees or conditions.

 Lower costs: Smart contracts can automate and simplify many of the transaction and contract processes, thereby reducing intermediary and transaction costs. This helps to reduce the cost of financial transactions.

Imtampability: Once a smart contract is deployed on a blockchain, its code and execution records are unlikely to be tampered with. This ensures the immutability of the contract.

 

***\*(2) Smart contracts on the DBX platform\****

 

 The DBX platform uses smart contracts to automate the execution of financial transactions and contracts. Here are the applications of smart contracts on the DBX platform:

 Transaction execution: Various financial transactions conducted by users on DBX platforms, such as capital transfer, investment and income withdrawal, can be automatically executed through smart contracts. This eliminates the need for intermediaries and improves the efficiency of trading.

 Asset management: Smart contracts can be used to manage digital assets, such as distributing income, reinvesting, and withdrawing assets. Users can set custom contract conditions to meet their specific financial objectives.

 Distributed autonomy: DBX communities and participants can develop consensus rules and decisions through smart contracts. This makes community governance more decentralized and transparent.

 Data security: Users' personal data and transaction data can be encrypted and protected through smart contracts, and only the contract parties can unlock and access the data.

In short, the smart contracts on the DBX platform take full advantage of the advantages of blockchain technology to automate the execution of financial contracts, reduce costs, and improve transparency and security. This helps to build a more open and fair financial world.

 

**3.** ***\*Data security and privacy protection\****

 

***\*(1) The importance of user data and privacy\****

 

 Users' data and privacy are an important part of any financial platform. The importance of protecting user data and privacy is that:

 Personal privacy protection: users have the right to protect their personal information, including their name, address, contact information, etc. Providing this information can lead to identity theft, harassment or other adverse consequences.

 Transaction privacy: In financial transactions, the user's assets and transaction history should remain confidential. Such information can lead to fund theft or identity exposure.

 Trust and reputation: The credibility and credibility of a platform is closely related to the way it handles user data and privacy. Protecting user data can enhance users' trust in the platform.

Regulatory compliance: Many countries and regions have data protection regulations that require financial institutions to protect user data. Violation of these regulations can lead to legal proceedings and fines.

 

***\*(2) How the DBX ensures the security and privacy of the data\****

 

 DBX is committed to ensuring the security and protection of user data and privacy. Here's how the DBX achieves this goal:

 Encryption technology: The user's data is protected by powerful encryption technology during transmission and storage. This ensures that data is not susceptible to unauthorized access when transferred and stored.

 Decentralized storage: DBX uses a decentralized storage method to store user data scattered on multiple nodes. This reduces the risk of a single point of attack and enhances the data security.

 Aonymous: The DBX platform allows users to maintain anonymity to some extent. Users can use an encrypted address to trade without disclosing personally identifiable information.

 User control: The user has full control of their data. They can choose to share or restrict access to their data and revoke the license at any time.



 Copliance: DBX complies with applicable data protection regulations and takes compliance measures in relation to data processing. This includes the transparent processing and protection of the user's data.

 Security Audit: DBX regularly conducts security audits to ensure the security of the platform. These audits are performed by independent third-party organizations and cover all aspects of the platform.

 User education: DBX provides user education to help users understand how to protect their personal data and privacy. This includes safety practices and risk management recommendations.

DBX is committed to ensuring the security and protection of user data and privacy, in order to build a secure and reliable financial platform, so that users can safely participate in financial transactions and contracts.



 

### 7„ÄÅeconomic model

****

 

**1.** ***\*The body system\****

 

***\*(1) Introduction of different types of celestial bodies\****

 

 In the economic model of DOUBLEX, the celestial system is the core component of the platform, which is divided into multiple different types, each with different characteristics and participation conditions. Here is a brief introduction to the various types of celestial objects:

 Nova: Nova is the most basic object type, representing the initial stage of the user joining the DOUBLEX. Users can participate in the platform by buying new stars and get corresponding rewards.

 Supernova: Supernova is an upgraded version of the nova, with higher participation conditions and rewards. Supernova holders can enjoy more rights and rewards.

 Galaxy: Galaxy is a higher level object, representing the more long-term investment and contribution of users on the platform. Galaxy holders have opportunities for greater rewards and privileges.

Dark matter: Dark matter is a special object, where some of the money is used to repurchase DBX tokens to maintain the stability of the market. Dark matter holders can enjoy certain rewards and participate in the ecological maintenance of the platform.

 

***\*(2) Participation conditions and reward mechanism of celestial bodies\****

 

Each object type has specific participation conditions and reward mechanisms to encourage user participation and contribution. The following is an overview of the main participation conditions and reward mechanisms for the different types of objects:

new star:

 Participation conditions: the purchase of a specified number of nova stars.

Reward: a portion of the platform transaction fees and a chance to be promoted to a higher level.

 

supernova:

 Participation conditions: purchase a specified number of supernovae and meet certain performance requirements.

Reward: a higher transaction fee than nova and more privileges.

 

the Milky WayÔºö 

 Participation conditions: purchase a specified number of Galaxy, and reach a certain performance level.

Reward mechanism: enjoy more rights of the platform and get a larger transaction fee.

 

dark matter:

 Participation conditions: Some of the DBX tokens will be locked into dark matter and automatically used for repurchase.

 Reward mechanism: enjoy repurchase rewards, and participate in maintaining the market stability of the platform.

The celestial body system encourages users to actively participate in and contribute to the platform, while enjoying the corresponding rewards and privileges. This multi-level economic model helps balance the ecosystem of the platform, encourage long-term user engagement and support the development of DOUBLEX.

 

**2.** ***\*Dimension space\****

 

DOUBLEX Dimension space is an important concept in the platform, which represents different levels of user participation and investment. Users can shuttle between different dimensions to achieve higher levels of engagement and rewards. Here are the details about the dimensional space:

 

***\*(1) How users can shuttle in different dimensions\****

 

 Users can travel between different dimensions according to their investment and participation level. The condition of the shuttle is usually holding a certain number of specific types of celestial bodies. Different types of celestial objects represent different dimensional spaces, and users can enter into different dimensions depending on their celestial holdings.

For example, holding a certain number of novae allows users to enter a dimension, while holding a supernova or Galaxy allows users to enter a higher level of dimension. Users can choose to travel freely between different dimensions, depending on their level of investment and participation.

 

***\*(2) Consumption and gain in the shuttle process\****

 

 Shuttle to different dimensions of space will involve some resources consumption, but also will bring some gain. Here are some of the possible consumption and gains involvedÔºö 

 Energy value: When shuttling to a higher level of dimension, the user may need to consume a certain amount of nova energy value. This energy value is usually held in the form of a nova, and shuttling consumes some of that energy.

 Reward gain: Entering a higher level dimension usually means that users can enjoy more rewards and interests. These rewards can be a split of transaction fees, higher privileges, or greater equity.

 Lucky nova Pool: The lucky nova pool may be involved in the shuttle process, and some of its resources will be consumed. Such pools are often associated with some mechanisms in the shuttling process and may affect user reward. 

In general, the concept of dimensional space allows users to travel freely according to their investment and participation level, with corresponding rewards and privileges. The shuttling between different dimensions involves the consumption of some resources, but it also provides users with more opportunities and potential to get more returns. This helps to balance participation and contribution among users and facilitate the development of the DOUBLEX ecosystem.

 

**3.** ***\*Big Bang mechanism\****

 

DOUBLEX Introduce the Big Bang mechanism, which is an important time cycle concept in the platform, which affects the stability and reward mechanism of the platform. Here are the details of the Big Bang mechanism:

 

***\*(1) The time period of the celestial body formation\****

 

In DOUBLEX, different types of celestial bodies (such as nova, supernova, the Milky Way, etc.) will form in a certain time period. This time cycle is usually controlled by the platform's rules and smart contracts. Each type of object has its own time period, after which time a large bang event is triggered.

 

***\*(2) How the Big Bang affects the platform\****

 

 The Big Bang is an important time event that has a great impact on the platform. Here are some aspects of how the Big Bang affected the platform:

 Reward reset: After the big bang, the platform will reset some rewards. This may include redistributing rewards, updating participation conditions or recalculating equity.

 Queuing reset: The big explosion could cause users in the queue to requeue, who will have to wait a while to reengage in the formation of celestial bodies.

 New opportunities: While the Big Bang may cause some changes, it also offers possibilities for new opportunities and participation. Users can re-participate, and be rewarded according to the new rules.

 Platform stability: The Big Bang mechanism helps to maintain the stability of the platform and its sustainability. It can prevent certain types of objects from exist indefinitely, thus maintaining the balance of the platforms.

Overall, the Big Bang mechanism is a key concept in DOUBLEX that contributes to platform development and stability. It ensures the reward mechanism of fairness, encourages active user participation, and contributes to the sustainability of the platform. Users need to understand the Big Bang mechanism to better participate in the DOUBLEX ecosystem.

 

**4.** ***\*DBX currency price and rise\****

 

DOUBLEX The DBX currency price uses a dynamic increase mechanism, designed to promote the development of the platform and user participation. Here are details about the price and rise of DBX:

 

***\*(1) The dynamic rise mechanism of DBX currency price\****

 

 DBX is different from traditional cryptocurrencies by using a dynamic upward mechanism to ensure the stability and sustainability of the platform. The mechanism usually includes the following elements:

 Repurchase mechanism: The platform regularly performs DBX repurchases, usually buying a certain amount of DBX from the market and destroying them to reduce the supply of DBX. This helps to maintain the stability of the currency price.

 User engagement: Users can be rewarded by participating in different types of objects, holding a certain amount of DBX, or performing specific operations. These rewards are often distributed as DBX, encouraging users to actively participate in the platform.

 Market demand: The price of DBX is usually affected by the market demand. If more users participate in the platform and buy DBX, then the currency price may rise. Instead, if there is oversupply, the price may fall.

Automatic trading: The platform may implement an automatic trading strategy to purchase or sell DBX based on market conditions, thus affecting the currency price. This can be done through smart contracts and performance algorithms.

 

***\*(2) The realization of automatic trading\****

 

 Automatic transactions are usually done through smart contracts and automated performance algorithms. Platforms can write smart contracts to perform buying and selling operations based on specific market indicators, price changes, or other factors. These smart contracts can be executed automatically, without human intervention.

 The implementation of automatic trading requires a high degree of technical and market analysis capabilities to ensure the effectiveness of trading strategies. This helps to maintain the stability of the DBX currency price and adjusts accordingly according to market conditions to meet the needs of the platform and users.

In general, DBX's dynamic price increase mechanism is an important part of the platform, which helps encourage users to participate in and support the development of the platform, while ensuring the stability and sustainability of the currency price. Users need to pay close attention to this mechanism to better understand the market performance of DBX.
